Installation
============

Easy, really. B^)


Tested platforms
----------------

Development of gsm-ussd was done on Kubuntu 9.10 and Kubuntu 10.04
(Beta), but any moderately recent linux distribution is expected to
work.

The only UMTS modem this script was tested with was a "MEDIONmobile (R)
web stick S4011", which is really only a relabeled Huawei E160 and
which identifies as such.

Any feedback on OSes and hardware you're running this script with is
deeply appreciated! Please mail your successes and fails to
"jochen@zum-quadrat.de". Thanks!


Prerequisites for building:
---------------------------

*	Perl 5.8 and up
	Older versions will do, too, but as you'll need Perl 5.8 for
	actually _running_ gsm-ussd, there's no point in using less, is
	there?

As gsm-ussd is a perl script, you won't even need perl for merely
installing it, but pod2man is needed for the creation of man pages.


Prerequisites for running:
--------------------------

*	Perl 5.8 and up
	Older versions miss the Encoding::GSM0338 module. 

*	Perl module "Expect" installed
	This module has other dependencies, which should be resolved
	by your package management tool or cpan, whichever you prefer
	for perl module installation.

*	A connected and supported UMTS modem. B^)
	This might as well be a tethered mobile phone which supports a 
	modem like interface. But as you can send USSD queries directly
	from the phone itself, this only makes sense if you want to
	automate something.


Installation:
-------------

Install Expect.pm:
$ sudo aptitude install libexpect-perl		# (K)Ubuntu, Debian
$ zypper install perl-Expect			# OpenSuSE (SLES?)
$ yum install perl-Expect			# Fedora (RedHat?)

Install gsm-ussd with manual pages:
$ make all
$ sudo make install install-doc

This will install gsm-ussd and its documentation in /usr/local. If
you want to install it in /usr, try

$ sudo make install install-doc PREFIX=/usr 

Happy USSD'ing!
