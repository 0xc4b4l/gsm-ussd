Installation
============

Easy, really. B^)

Any feedback on OSes and hardware you're running this script with is
deeply appreciated! Please mail your successes and fails to
"jochen@zum-quadrat.de". Thanks!


Tested platforms
----------------

Development of gsm-ussd was done on Kubuntu 9.10 and Kubuntu 10.04,
but any moderately recent linux distribution is expected to
work. The package generated by "make deb" was successfully tested on
Debian 5, Sidux 2009/4, Kubuntu 9.10 and Kubuntu 10.04. The package
generated by "make rpm" was successfully tested on Fedora Core 12
and SLES 10.

  Card only came up with the ZeroCD-Image as /dev/sr1, no serial
  devices were created. No success with usb_modeswitch. Not enough
  time to dig any deeper.


Prerequisites for building:
---------------------------

*	Perl 5.8 and up
	Older versions will do, too, but as you'll need Perl 5.8 for
	actually _running_ gsm-ussd, there's no point in using less, is
	there?

As gsm-ussd is a perl script, you won't even need perl for merely
installing it, but pod2man is needed for the creation of man pages.


Prerequisites for running:
--------------------------

*	Perl 5.8 and up
	Older versions miss the Encoding::GSM0338 module. 

*	Perl module "Expect" installed
	This module has other dependencies, which should be resolved
	by your package management tool or cpan, whichever you prefer
	for perl module installation.

*	A connected and supported UMTS modem. B^)
	This might as well be a tethered mobile phone which supports a 
	modem like interface. But as you can send USSD queries directly
	from the phone itself, this only makes sense if you want to
	automate something.


Installation:
-------------

Install Expect.pm:
  $ sudo aptitude install libexpect-perl	# (K)Ubuntu, Debian
  $ zypper install perl-Expect			# OpenSuSE (SLES?)
  $ yum install perl-Expect			# Fedora (RedHat?)

Install gsm-ussd with manual pages:
  $ make all
  $ sudo make install install-doc

This will install gsm-ussd and its documentation in /usr/local. If
you want to install it in /usr, try

  $ sudo make install install-doc PREFIX=/usr 

Do you prefer a Debian package?

  $ make deb
  $ sudo dpkg -i packages/gsm-ussd*.deb

Or is your Linux distribution RPM based?

  $ make rpm
  $ sudo rpm -ihv packages/gsm-ussd*.rpm

The generated .deb or .rpm file will be in the packages subdirectory.


Happy USSD'ing!
