USSD sessions
=============

Warning
-------

Please note that support for USSD sessions is still young and might
not be complete, as I have exactly one opportunity for testing 
(and research). So take care: If you incur any costs while trying
USSD sessions, you'll have to pay yourself! 


Explanation
-----------

The most common USSD queries are one-shots: Querying your prepaid
account balance, topping up your account, querying your own
telephone number and so on. gsm-ussd will do the query, receive
a response and that is that.

But some other USSD queries will start a USSD session. The response
code is 1 (Further action required) instead of 0 (No further action
required). While the session is running, the response code will 
always be 1. Typically you'll see a simple menu with numbers to choose
the menu entries or a text instructing you to enter some numbers, such
as top up codes, PINs etc.

While in a session, sending a "normal" USSD query will not necessarily
work; instead, the menu or instruction might be repeated.

So how do you get out of a USSD session? Either the network provider
has got enough information from you so that he will send a USSD
response of 0; this will end the session. Or you yourself cancel the
session by running gsm-ussd with the option "--cancel" (or "-c" for
short). No harm will be done if you call "gsm-ussd -c" if no session
is active: You will simply get a message that there was no session 
to cancel. 


Example
-------

This is a little session as an example how USSD sessions can work.
Unfortunately, as I live in Germany, this session is in German too,
but the gist of it should become clear from my comments. 

Let's start with a simple USSD query:

	$ ./gsm-ussd.pl '*100#'
	USSD session open, to cancel use "gsm-ussd -c".
	Tchibo mobil Servicemenü:
	1 Kontoabfrage
	2 Guthaben-Verfügbarkeit
	3 Aufladung Guthabenkarte
	4 Optionsmanager
	$

The first line (USSD session open, ...) is printed on STDERR if gsm-ussd
receives a USSD response code of 1, i.e. a session is open. The service
menu displayed lets me query my account balance (1), the activity time (2),
top up my account (3) and choose an option manager to subscribe or cancel
different tariffs (4). 

	$ ./gsm-ussd.pl '4'
	USSD session open, to cancel use "gsm-ussd -c".
	Optionsmanager 

	1 Optionsstatus 
	2 Option buchen 
	$

Now, please note that the argument to gsm-ussd is a simple number without
'*' or '#'. If you send anything else, even other legal USSD queries, the
only effect will be that the menu is displayed again!

	$ ./gsm-ussd.pl '*101#'
	USSD session open, to cancel use "gsm-ussd -c".
	Optionsmanager 

	1 Optionsstatus 
	2 Option buchen 
	$

See? Within the session, the query for my account balance is not directly 
available.

	$ ./gsm-ussd.pl '1'
	USSD session open, to cancel use "gsm-ussd -c".
	Folgende Optionen sind gebucht: 

	1 100 Minuten kostenlos 
	0 Abbruch 

Alright, these are my options. "Abbruch" equals "Cancel", so can I choose
"0" to end the session?

	$ ./gsm-ussd.pl '0'
	USSD session open, to cancel use "gsm-ussd -c".
	Tchibo mobil Servicemenü:
	1 Kontoabfrage
	2 Guthaben-Verfügbarkeit
	3 Aufladung Guthabenkarte
	4 Optionsmanager
	$

No, this is only a shortcut to the main menu.

	$ ./gsm-ussd.pl -c
	USSD cancel request successful
	$

Running gsm-ussd with option -c instead cancels the session. Now, will *101#
work again?

	$ ./gsm-ussd.pl '*101#'
	Ihr Tchibo mobil Guthaben beträgt: 1.00 Euro.
	$ 

Yes, it does, that's my account balance. I'm rich! Let's try that --cancel
option again:

	$ ./gsm-ussd.pl -c
	No USSD session to cancel.
	$

Well, we knew that, but no harm in checking, is there?

So now you know how USSD sessions work and how gsm-ussd can be used to 
handle them. If you encounter USSD menus that work different, let me
know!
