TODO
====

This is just a collection of ideas. Care to comment?

* Translate CME/CMS ERRORs, so that you'll get 
	"Network error: No network service" 
  instead of
	"Network error: 30"

* Query +CMEE, set it to 1 to receive CMS/CME ERROR messages,
  reset it to old value.

* Instead of a fixed waiting time for the modem to find its net
  after unlocking the SIM, poll it regularly until it reports 
  that it has found its net.

* A small GUI, built around tools like zenity, kdialog or xdialog
  or even kommander.

* Add another option "-v|--verbose", which will query and output
  modem type, net the modem is logged into and other trivia.

* Add support and Makefile targets for DEB and RPM packages for
  an even easier installation.

* Some kind of localisation?
  I'd prefer to keep this little script as selfcontained as possible,
  so I probably won't build some gettext()/.po-file infrastructure.
  But as there are not _that_ many user visible messages, I can
  imagine some internal support for English/German/French/Spanish
  messages. Of course, the actual translation (apart from English
  and German) would have to be done by someone else...


NOT TO DO
=========

These are things I will *not* consider doing to my poor script:

* Get it to run under Windows.
  There's no shortage of tools for this on Windows; furthermore,
  I have absolutely no experience talking to modems on Windows.
  If someone wants to have a try: Substitute "COMx:" for
  "/dev/ttyUSBx" and go from there.

* Get it to send SMSes, set the modem clock, read phone book entries 
  off the SIM, ...
  All of that _can_ be done, of course, but there are already better
  tools for that available. gsm-ussd is supposed to be a one trick
  pony only!
