TODO
====

This is just a collection of ideas. Care to comment?

* Translate CME/CMS ERRORs, so that you'll get 
	"Network error: No network service" 
  instead of
	"Network error: 30"

* Query +CMEE, set it to 1 to receive CMS/CME ERROR messages,
  reset it to old value.

* Instead of a fixed waiting time for the modem to find its net
  after unlocking the SIM, poll it regularly until it reports 
  that it has found its net.

* A small GUI, built around tools like zenity, kdialog or xdialog,
  maybe even kommander.


NOT TO DO
=========

These are things I will not consider doing to my poor script:

* Get it to run under Windows.
  There's no shortage of tools for this on Windows; furthermore,
  I have absolutely no experience talking to modems on Windows.
  If someone wants to have a try: Substitute "COMx:" for
  "/dev/ttyUSBx" and go from there.

* Get it to send SMSes, set the modem clock, read phone book entries 
  off the SIM, ...
  All of that _can_ be done, of course, but there are already better
  tools for that available.
