Description: Tool to send USSD queries via GSM or UMTS modems
 This program lets you send USSD (Unstructured Supplementary
 Services Data) with your GSM or UMTS modem. USSD queries are
 "phone numbers" like "*100#", which will result in a message
 (NOT a SMS) with your current prepaid account balance.
 .
 You can use this program to query your own phone number, 
 replenish your prepaid account, query your free minutes left
 and so on, depending on your GSM provider.
