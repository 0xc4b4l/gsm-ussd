Please note:
============

Scripts in this directory are part and parcel of the Makefile
infrastructure to build a .tar or .deb file. They are meant to be called

* in a git repository 
* from their corresponding Makefile targets (deb, tar)
* with the packages directory as working directory, which the
  Makefile targets will take care of.

Should you have a mind to play with these scripts, get the git
repository (git://github.com/JochenHoch2/gsm-ussd.git) and then
do a

$ make

in the top level directory first as the scripts expect
the documentation to have been built.
