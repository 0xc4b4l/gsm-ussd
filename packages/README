Please note:
============

Scripts in this directory are part and parcel of the Makefile
infrastructure to build a .tar or .deb file. They are meant to be called

* from their corresponding Makefile targets (deb, tar)
* with the packages directory as working directory, which the
  Makefile targets will take care of.

Should you have a mind to play with these scripts, do a 

$ make

in the top level directory first as at least mkdeb.sh expects
the documentation to have been built.
